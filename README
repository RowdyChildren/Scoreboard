This is based on Carolina Roller Derby Scoreboard, it is a simplified interface, all the controls are generarlly the same.
Since you're reading this, you should already have the scoreboard code.

If you don't have Java 1.5 or later installed in your system, go get it ( http://java.com ) and install it.

Once you have Java installed, run the program for your system (listed below) that is in the same directory as this README.
Windows: scoreboard-Windows.exe
Mac: scoreboard-Mac.app
Linux: scoreboard-Linux.sh

Then, open (double-click) the "start.html" page that is in the same directory as this README
(or, just open a browser to http://localhost:8000/ )

The web page that opens in your browser has more details on how to use the scoreboard.
